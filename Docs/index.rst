The Dispa-SET model
===================

The Dispa-SET model is an open-source unit commitment and optimal dispatch model focused on the balancing and flexibility problems in European grids. Its pre and post-processing tools are written in Python and the main solver can be called via GAMS. 
 
Dispa-SET is mainly developed within the Joint Research Centre of the EU Commission, in close collaboration with the University of Liège and the KU Leuven (Belgium).
